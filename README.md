# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?
An exploration of coupon acceptance rates

**Jupyter notebook:** https://github.com/cheeseinvert/driving-coupon-eda/blob/main/prompt.ipynb

## What is the problem? 
This project aims to apply exploritory data analysis, visualizations and probability distributions to understand the distinguishing characteristics between customers who accepted coupons presented while driving versus those who did not. Newly aqcuired techniques of statistical summarization are showcased here to present data-driven findings.

## What is the data?
This data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. There are three possible answers people can choose from:

- **“Right away”**
- **“Later, before the coupon expires”**
- **“No, I do not want the coupon”**
